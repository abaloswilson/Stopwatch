# Stopwatch

A minimal stopwatch web app implemented with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Overview
This is a small project that demonstrates a simple stopwatch with start, stop, lap, and reset functionality.

## Files
- index.html — app HTML
- style.css — styles
- script.js — stopwatch logic

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the Start/Stop and Reset buttons to control the stopwatch.

For development, you can run a local server (for example, using VS Code Live Server) to serve the files and get live reload.
